# Agentic AI Trip Planner with LLMOps

This project is an **Agentic AI-powered Trip Planner**, designed to plan trips for **any city worldwide using real-time data**. The system intelligently collaborates between multiple AI agents to fetch live weather, popular attractions, hotel costs, currency conversions, and generates a complete trip summary with an itinerary and total expense estimation.

It combines the power of **LangGraph-based AI agents**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and real-time APIs, structured using modern **LLMOps principles**.

Agents are based on Reasoning + Action framework (source: https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629)

## Architecture Overview

- **Agent Orchestration:** Built using **LangGraph**, managing nodes (tools) and edges (workflow execution).
- **Modular Design:** Tools for weather, places, currency, expenses, and summaries are isolated and reusable.
- **Prompt Library:** Modular prompts power the LLM for generating human-like summaries.
- **API Layer:** Managed via **FastAPI** for handling user requests.
- **Deployment-Ready:** Supports CI/CD pipelines and deployment to cloud services like AWS or Render.
